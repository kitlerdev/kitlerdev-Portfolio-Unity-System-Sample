# kitlerdev-Portfolio-Unity-System-Sample
A simple sample of a Unity audio manager.  includes a data container and a core manager, both of which are clean C# scripts.  exhibits event-driven design, scalable architecture, and the division of logic and data.  Perfect for integration or learning.  A section of my technical portfolio.

How TO Use it -
1. Add the Audio Manager Script to a GameObject 
1. Add AudioData objects in the 'sound' array\n2. Click the button to generate constants\n3. Use: AudioManager.Play(Audio.YourSoundName);
